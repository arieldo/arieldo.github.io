<!-- # Positions -->
We are *always* looking for motivated individuals to join our research group. Further details are given below:
* [Postdoctoral Research Fellows](#Postdoctoral)
* [Graduate Students (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)](#GraduateStudents)
* [Undergraduate students](#underGraduateStudents)

## Postdoctoral Research Fellows
<div id="Postdoctoral"></div>
Multiple postdoctoral research fellow positions are available in the area of single and multi-robot autonomous perception, navigation and planning under uncertainty in the context of mobile robotics.

Successful candidates will work with Associate Prof. Vadim Indelman and his research group, and will have the opportunity to contribute to ongoing multi-disciplinary research efforts while also developing their own research line. Applicants should have a Ph.D. (or about to graduate) in Electrical, Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science or Applied Mathematics. A strong background in at least one of the areas mentioned above is required. Hands on experience and programming skills are an advantage.

This is a full-time, one-year, non-tenure-track appointment with possibility of extension subject to available funding and satisfactory performance. Funds for some conference travel and research expenses will also be provided. Starting date is flexible.

Applicants are encouraged to send by email a cover letter that briefly describes their background and career plans, a CV and copies of up to three relevant publications. For more information please explore this website, or contact Associate Prof. Vadim Indelman via [email](mailto:vadim.indelman@technion.ac.il).


## Graduate Students (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)
<div id="GraduateStudents"></div>
We are looking for motivated M.Sc. and Ph.D. students interested in multi-disciplinary research in autonomous systems to join our research group. Multiple research topics are available involving different aspects of mobile robotics, including:

- Planning under uncertainty and AI
- Semantic perception and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
- Data-driven and machine (deep) learning based perception and autonomous navigation
- Distributed multi-robot systems

Problems of interest span autonomous operation in aerial, indoor, urban and space (static and dynamic) environments. An overview of on-going and past research projects can be found here.

Students from the Department of Aerospace Engineering and from other relevant departments, including Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, (Applied) Mathematics, Data and Decisions Science, and Mechanical Engineering are welcome to apply. International students are welcome to apply. For more information, please contact Assoc. Prof. Vadim Indelman by [email](mailto:vadim.indelman@technion.ac.il).

## Undergraduate students 
<div id="underGraduateStudents"></div>
Undergraduate student? Join us and get involved in research activities early. You will have the opportunity to learn cutting-edge technology in robotics, participate in implementation of novel algorithms and conduct experiments with aerial and ground robots.

Motivated and open-minded students in their 4th semester (and later) are encouraged to get in touch  by [email](mailto:vadim.indelman@technion.ac.il).
