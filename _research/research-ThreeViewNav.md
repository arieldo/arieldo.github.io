descriptio: "In this research, we introduced the usage of three-view constraints for navigation-aiding in a monocular camera configuration. A new formulation of three-view constraints was developed, that includes in addition to the well-known epipolar constraints, a new constraint that allows to maintain a consistent scale even in co-linear camera configurations (which is not possible with only epipolar constraints). Given three overlapping images and the associated navigation solutions, the three-view constraints allow to reduce position errors in all axes to the levels present while the Ô¨Årst two images were captured. The developed approach (see TAES2012) eliminates the need in the intermediate step of 3D point estimations and can be used for navigation-aiding based on nearby overlapping imagery as well as loop closures. In the latter case, only 3 images are required to incorporate loop closure information into the navigation system, as opposed to processing all images in the loop chain as conventionally done in other methods.

Three-view geometry constraints are also applied in distributed cooperative navigation and in incremental light bundle adjustment (iLBA)."
