### Overview : 

* Scanning process – 3D scanning is the process of capturing digital information about the shape of an object with equipment that uses a laser or light to measure the distance between the scanner and the object 
* Robotic Mapping - The goal for an autonomous robot is to be able to construct (or use) a map
or floor plan and to localize itself in it. Robotic mapping is a branch that deals with the study and
application of ability to construct such a map by an autonomous robot and to localize itself in it.

### Project Definition : 

We would like to perform a robust and autonomous
mapping of a room or a set of rooms (e.g. an apartment).
We are looking to do this scan as complete and fast as
possible, without falling on the quality. We propose a
project to create an autonomous scan using multiple
(ground and/or aerial) robots, in order to achieve that goal.

### Outputs 

* Proof of concept (POC) a single robot autonomously mapping an indoor area in a minimal time.
* POC multi-robot scenario of mapping an indoor area and showing improvement in scan time.
* Academic paper in a leading international conference (e.g. ICRA).

### Logistics 

* The project will be initially for 1 semester, with a potential extension to a 2nd semester due its large
scope and great potential
* The project is offered both to undergraduate and graduate students with appropriate background

### Prerequisites:

* Strong programming skills (preferably Python or C++). 
* Background in (deep) reinforcement learning, computer vision, robotics is an advantage.
* Path planning and Control theory – Advantage
