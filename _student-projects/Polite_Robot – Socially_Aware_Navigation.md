Social aware navigation is a subfield of robotics concerned with avoiding possible collisions of a
robot with humans, animals, etc. In this project, we will try to take one step forward towards
the coexistence of humans and robots. Specifically, first we will simulate a scenario in which the
robot is at rest, and a person is walking towards it. The robot has to detect a possible collision
and move appropriately, making a safe pass for the person. Several extensions will be then
considered.

### Prerequisites:
- Strong programming skills (preferably Python or C++). Background in (deep) reinforcement learning, computer vision, robotics is an advantage.
