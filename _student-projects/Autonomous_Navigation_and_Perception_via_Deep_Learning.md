In this project we shall investigate approaches to address autonomous navigation and
perception in unknown environments via deep learning. Specific project objectives will be
determined together with the student(s).

### Prerequisites:
- Strong programming skills (preferably Python or C++). Background in (deep) reinforcement learning, computer vision, robotics is an advantage.

### Academic supervisor:
- Prof. Vadim Indelman [mail](mailto:vadim.indelman@technion.ac.il)

Duration: 1 or 2 semesters
