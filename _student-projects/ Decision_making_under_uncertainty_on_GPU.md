Decision making under uncertainty is
exceptionally computationally demanding. Since
the robot has to decide online the best action, a
typical approach is to approximate the decision-
making mechanism. In this project, we will
harness the capabilities of the bleeding edge
scientific language [JULIA](https://julialang.org/) alongside NVIDIA
CUDA to move computations to GPU.
By massive parallelization, we hope to solve the
decision making problem precisely.
